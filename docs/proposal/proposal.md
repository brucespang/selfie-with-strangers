# Proposal

## Introducing Selfie with Strangers

Sometimes you desperately need to take a selfie, but none of your friends are around. Othertimes, you just want to meet someone new: you might be on a trip, moving to a new city, or just bored out of your mind in a waiting room.

The selfie is the perfect way to do this. By using the selfie, Selfie with Strangers is the best way for people to meet each other, be adventurous, and have photographic evidence they can share with their friends later.

## Description

You're in a coffee shop, currently experiencing some pretty major writer's block. You get a notification saying that a person nearby you is using Selfie with Strangers. You find that person and take a selfie with them. You are both then given a silly question, and have to enter the other person's answer. You can then share the selfie with a public feed, or your favorite social network.

If you like the person you met, or maybe if their answer intrigues you, you can hang out and chat with them. If not, you've finished taking a selfie and can leave without weirdness. Either way, when you get back to writing, you'll be full of inspiration, having just met a new person and taken the perfect selfie.

You can view the feed of selfies and answers to get selfie-spiration, to read answers to questions that are amusing or heartbreaking, and to find interesting places near you.

## Relation to other courses

In Sociology, we learned that this lack of interaction is explained because people feel comfortable with those who they are similar with. However, there are great people all around to talk to and share moments with.

From Journalism, our group learned about the importance of hearing information from many different sources. This helps to give a person a better understanding of the world and people around them.

We believe that by integrating photography into our application it will be a fun way to get people to interact with one another. They can have fun making silly pictures. Furthermore, from a Photography class, we learned about the importance of observing the world us. People can meet to take pictures at interesting locations. Other will see these pictures and will discover new places.

In addition, economics principles will guide the funding our web start-up receives. Knowledge gained from Money and Banking (ECON 311) can be used to keep track of spending. Thus, our company is more financially responsible to invest in.

We believe that our Computer Science courses can guide us in creating an application where people can interact with one another with photography.  In CS305, one of the topics we discussed about was the ways technology was distracting from direct human contact. We want to be mindful of this fact when we create our application to actually help people interact with one another in person. We want technology to help facilitate the meetings. Also, our experiences from CS320 and CS311 will help us design a fun and useful application that runs efficiently.  We will plan out how the different components will fit and interact with each other, so it will be easier to integrate our code.

## Relation to other projects

### Tinder et al.

While both Tinder and Selfie with Strangers are apps for meeting people, Selfie with Strangers is not intended for dating. There are no expectations that a person you meet through Selfie with Strangers will be in your life longer than it takes to snap a selfie. This reduces the amount invested in each interaction, which will help people be more genuine, and thus, meet more people.

### Somebody

While both Somebody and Selfie with Strangers involve meeting random strangers, Somebody deals with sending personal messages through strangers, while Selfie with Strangers has no personal elements.

### Highlight

Highlight is an app which notifies you if people you might like are nearby. While Highlight is interesting, a selfie is the perfect way to meet someone. Highlight does not have selfies, so highlight is imperfect.

### Selfie apps

There are many selfie apps (e.g. b612). They do not tell you when someone you know is nearby, just help you take selfies.

### Rando

Rando is like Selfie with Strangers, if the "with" meant "send to" instead of "take with".

## Privacy and Safety

### Safety Concerns
In any situation where strangers are being asked to meet in the physical world, there is obviously the concern of each person's safety. We are taking a few measures to ensure that this is not an issue for Selfies with Strangers:
- Meetings are arranged by proposing a time and a place to each participant until they both approve. This way, no real-time location data about one participant is given to another.
- Meeting places will consist of a list of approved, public locations like Amherst Common or WEB DuBois library.
- We are considering restricting meeting times to daylight hours.
- Users will be given the option to report other users who have made them feel unsafe. Users who are reported over a certain number of times will be banned.

###Privacy Concerns
Another sensitive topic relevant to our proposed application is the privacy of shared data like a group selfie. We are also taking measures to prevent breaches of personal privacy.
- We would like pictures taken with the app to be accessible only through the app. There will possibly be a timer on the availability similar to snapchat.
- Both users must see the picture and approve before it is uploaded to the public selfie stream.
