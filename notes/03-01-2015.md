## Weekly Notes - Week of 2/23 - 3/1

##In attendance:
Alex Burkatovskiy, Bruce Spang, Caleb Larson, Oskar Singer, Wesley Fung, Zachery May

##Discussion
All members were present and contributed this week. This week we focused primarily on dividing the responsibilities for the next project assignment. In order to do that, we had to focus our direction. As a group, we drove our vision one step further and brought things to a state where individuals in the group can go on and perform their task in the project. We will then reconvene next week in order to compile the pieces and make final decisions.

Some other tasks discussed were the machine learning aspects of the matching algorithm. Machine learning could even be used for pagerank values of the newsfeed. Further investigation will be done as a group.

##Tasks
The dividing of the assignment is as follows: 

Alex: Scenarios
Caleb: Idea summary and non-goals
Zac: User perspective flowchart, presentation
Wesley: UI Wireframes
Bruce: UI explanations from user’s perspective
Oskar: Open issues, scenarios

Everyone: Project relation to integrative experience will appear throughout the sections.

##Issues
No issues were brought up at this week’s meeting.
