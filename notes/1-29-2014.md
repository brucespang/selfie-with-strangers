# Notes for 1-29-2014

- each pitched an idea:
  - online game ai for go
	- cool machine learning on the backend, make the ai really good
	- game is fun, strategy is complex and sort of an interesting problem in ML
	- papers and stuff on how to implement it
	- javascript library for convolutional neural nets
	- interesting problems for online play
  - selfie with strangers
	- ART/useless
	- send a random precious/semi-private thing to a random person
	- no control over what's sent
	- **ethical concerns**
	- timed viewing
  - music playlist idea (+1)
	- parties/bars - like a jukebox
	- queue songs on a playlist from any internet enabled device
	- some sort of privacy/invitation for a room
	- stream from multiple services/maybe local?
	- tricky legal stuff
  - trivia game
	- multi-user trivia game on your phone
	- room code
	- all options are currently terrible
	- see a question, four options
	- "fun to play while you’re getting drunk with friends"
  - recipe idea
	- social stuff, commenting on recipes
	- ingredient of the week, user competition sort of thing
	- grocery stuff
	- "what can I fucking make (for drinks)?”
- picked idea: selfies with strangers
- for next meeting: come up with what it does, consider names
