#Team Meeting 04/22/2015 - Approximately 17:30 EST

##In attendance:
Alex Burkatovsky, Bruce Spang, Caleb Larson, Oskar Singer, Wesley Fung, Zachery May

##Discussion
With only a little over a week until the project is due, our heroes meet once more to discuss what is left to do. Zac has been assigned to do the videos for the final project. This is planned to be shot and done by 4/26/2015. Alex gave a demonstration of how the camera works and can post pictures to our newsfeed. Oskar explained how he is going to use machine learning to improve location services by having labels and finding common meeting areas. Caleb volunteered to help Oskar implement this 4/23/2015. Bruce demonstrated creating a user and logging in.

Windows development issues have persisted in terms of running the website server, so our heroes reassigned tasks as seen below. The question engine has been implemented, users are now given an ice breaker question when they have a location match with another person. It was decided that the design doc will ultimately be edited to include an extra API's once the website is deemed to be ready for submission.
