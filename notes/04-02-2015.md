## Discussion
This week we focused on finishing the technical specification and laying down the framework. There was significant discusison on the database. One issue we encountered was deciding whether or not selfies should be saved in the database. We concluded that the metadata should be saved (not necessarily the picture though). Saving some of this information may prove useful for machine learning algorithms later on. We also agreed that we should be careful about what we save in order to not hold any sensitive information on users (such as location) for security purposes. We ironed out details for the database tables and outlined the schemas.

We also make revisions based on comments from our previous assignments. For example, we added some additional use cases. 

Upcoming tasks are to continue and expand on what was assigned to everyone last week. This involves finalizing the necessary api and beginning implementation. This also involves further researching libraries we will need.
