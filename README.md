# Project Overview
You get a notification saying that a person nearby you is using Selfie with Strangers. The application tells you two where to meet.  After you find that person and take a selfie with them, you are both then given a silly question, and have to enter the other person's answer. You can then share the selfie with a public feed, or your favorite social network.

If you like the person you met, or maybe if their answer intrigues you, you can hang out and chat with them. If not, you've finished taking a selfie and can leave without weirdness. You can view the feed of selfies and answers to get selfie-spiration, to read answers to questions that are amusing or heartbreaking, and to find interesting places near you.
