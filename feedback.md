# Project 1 Feedback

## Bios

I found your bios to be quite intriguing! I like that your team has a mix of members with industry experience and interdisciplinary study, and that you are from all over the world!

## Idea

You really didn't list much of an idea, although I do find the idea of taking selfies with strangers interesting. Are you familar with artist/author Miranda July? She recently made an app called Somebody, where users would be chosen to deliver a message to a stranger in person in their vicinity. It allowed people to interact who would've never otherwise interacted. 

## Logo

I like that you made both a vector and raster version of your logo! (The vector will probably come in handy later!) I also like how clean your logo is, though I wonder if "Selfie" should be the same size of "With Strangers." (Being smaller, "With Strangers" visibly reads as a subtitle)

## Overall

Selfies, I'm giving you a **weak thumbs up**. I wish you would've written a sentence or two about your idea in addition to listing possible areas of interest.
