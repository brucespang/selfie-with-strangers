Dearest Selfies,

In your “Software Components” section, I really appreciated how you included sample code of how the library/API is used! Great job overall!

A few points:

You mention that you plan to create a SwS API with Flask. You didn’t go into specifics on what features the API would have or how it fits into your application flow. (Note: In your team notes for 04/09/2015, you mention deciding to include an API section in your dspec, so I’m not sure if you forgot to include it.)

I thought the browser-camera was a cool solution, but I’m worried that it isn’t supported in mobile browsers. There are several comments on that blog post from users having difficulty using browser-camera on mobile. (I suspect that the problem is that the HTML5 function that browser-camera relies on “getUserMedia” doesn’t seem to be supported by any mobile browser: http://mobilehtml5.org/) Still, you should definitely test out browser-camera and see if it works on your mobile devices. (Or hack a solution to make it work)

EDIT: I opened the browser-camera demo (http://davidwalsh.name/demo/camera.php) on my iPhone and it didn't work. Also, the demo page states that "Using Opera Next or Chrome Canary, use this page to take your picture!" 

Selfies, I’m giving you a **4** out of 5. If you test browser-camera on iPhone and/or Android and give a rough summary of the SwS API’s functionalities and place in the app, by Tuesday April 21st, then I’ll give you a 5. If you find a way to make browser-camera work, you can just write in your dspec that you tested it successfully, if not, you’ll need to find an alternative way to access the phone’s camera. Totally optional, but I think it’d be really helpful to make sure the camera will work.

If you have any questions, you can email me at helgapataki326@gmail.com

Hello my Selfies,

Thank you for making your use cases more expansive!

You've been given a **5** out of 5.

Have a great Saturday,

Hello again Selfies,
 
Before I start, I’d like to mention that your peace sign icon does resemble AngelList’s icon. I know I should’ve mentioned this sooner, so I won’t count it against you if you keep it. If you plan on launching SwS after 326 has ended, it may be wise to rethink your icon as AngelList is a large player in the startup world.
 
I wish your Use Cases were more expansive. There were no use cases of creating an account, changing personal settings, or sharing a selfie outside of SwS. (with the Share button, referring to your wireframes) The characters and scenarios of your cases were varied and fantastic, but the functionality of SwS they portrayed were all the same. (Finding someone, taking a picture, becoming friends)
 
Speaking of becoming friends, I found it intriguing that one of your non-goals was that SwS is not an app for staying in touch! I would like to see a use case of what happens after the selfie to sustain the new friendship. Do the two exchange numbers? Does one find the other on FB? If you really don’t want to have friend functionality on SwS, you may want to consider assisting the two by connecting them on another platform. (ex: could you add button on SwS for one to send the other a FB friend request?)
 
I also really enjoyed your hand-drawn wireframes!
 
Dear Strangers, I’m going to give you a **4 out of 5**. If you redo your Use Cases to show all of SwS’s functionalities (even the dull ones!) by **Saturday, April 4th**, then you will get a **5**.
 
Until we meet again,
Helga G. Pataki

My dear Selfies,

Your section on how SwS is unique to other apps is fantastic, though I wonder how you may be able to learn from why some of your competitors have failed. Rando, specifically, failed as it was unable to generate revenue or interest. (People weren't digging antisocial networks? http://techcrunch.com/2014/03/22/rip-rando/ ) I like that you address your non-goal of remaining a platonic app. Highlight is interesting, though you are right to point out that it doesn't facilitate real-world activity. That is why I find Somebody and SwS interesting. 

I liked your idea of an ice-breaker question, and pointing to your notes, I like that you position it before the users take the selfie. Tinder has this problem where when you match with another user, there isn't a forced ice-breaker, just an awkward silence until someone makes the first move. Tinder tries to facilitate this (I believe it prompts the user to "Say Hello!" or something to their new match) but having a mandatory initial interaction would be interesting. 

I do like your attention to privacy, especially that both users need to approve an image before it gets released on social networks. Your privacy concern with limiting meeting locations and times, however, somewhat contradicts with your initial description of being in a coffee shop. Would two users in the same coffee shop need to move to an approved location (Dubois Library, for instance) before taking a selfie? 

I found your budget breakdown great, and awesome job at keeping up on weekly meeting notes! I'm extremely excited to see how SwS grows.

You've been fully funded and have received a *strong thumbs up*. 

PS- Really cool to see you've bought a domain already!

## Bios

I found your bios to be quite intriguing! I like that your team has a mix of members with industry experience and interdisciplinary study, and that you are from all over the world!

## Idea

You really didn't list much of an idea, although I do find the idea of taking selfies with strangers interesting. Are you familar with artist/author Miranda July? She recently made an app called Somebody, where users would be chosen to deliver a message to a stranger in person in their vicinity. It allowed people to interact who would've never otherwise interacted. 

## Logo

I like that you made both a vector and raster version of your logo! (The vector will probably come in handy later!) I also like how clean your logo is, though I wonder if "Selfie" should be the same size of "With Strangers." (Being smaller, "With Strangers" visibly reads as a subtitle)

## Overall

Selfies, I'm giving you a **weak thumbs up**. I wish you would've written a sentence or two about your idea in addition to listing possible areas of interest.
