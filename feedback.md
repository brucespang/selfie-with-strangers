My dear Selfies,

Your section on how SwS is unique to other apps is fantastic, though I wonder how you may be able to learn from why some of your competitors have failed. Rando, specifically, failed as it was unable to generate revenue or interest. (People weren't digging antisocial networks? http://techcrunch.com/2014/03/22/rip-rando/ ) I like that you address your non-goal of remaining a platonic app. Highlight is interesting, though you are right to point out that it doesn't facilitate real-world activity. That is why I find Somebody and SwS interesting. 

I liked your idea of an ice-breaker question, and pointing to your notes, I like that you position it before the users take the selfie. Tinder has this problem where when you match with another user, there isn't a forced ice-breaker, just an awkward silence until someone makes the first move. Tinder tries to facilitate this (I believe it prompts the user to "Say Hello!" or something to their new match) but having a mandatory initial interaction would be interesting. 

I do like your attention to privacy, especially that both users need to approve an image before it gets released on social networks. Your privacy concern with limiting meeting locations and times, however, somewhat contradicts with your initial description of being in a coffee shop. Would two users in the same coffee shop need to move to an approved location (Dubois Library, for instance) before taking a selfie? 

I found your budget breakdown great, and awesome job at keeping up on weekly meeting notes! I'm extremely excited to see how SwS grows.

You've been fully funded and have received a *strong thumbs up*. 

PS- Really cool to see you've bought a domain already!

## Bios

I found your bios to be quite intriguing! I like that your team has a mix of members with industry experience and interdisciplinary study, and that you are from all over the world!

## Idea

You really didn't list much of an idea, although I do find the idea of taking selfies with strangers interesting. Are you familar with artist/author Miranda July? She recently made an app called Somebody, where users would be chosen to deliver a message to a stranger in person in their vicinity. It allowed people to interact who would've never otherwise interacted. 

## Logo

I like that you made both a vector and raster version of your logo! (The vector will probably come in handy later!) I also like how clean your logo is, though I wonder if "Selfie" should be the same size of "With Strangers." (Being smaller, "With Strangers" visibly reads as a subtitle)

## Overall

Selfies, I'm giving you a **weak thumbs up**. I wish you would've written a sentence or two about your idea in addition to listing possible areas of interest.
